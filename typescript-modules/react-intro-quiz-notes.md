## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are modules?

Modules are multiple files in React containing components and sub-components. Modules are a collection of code in an external file which performs a specific task of function.

- What is the difference between named and default imports?

Default imports contain the name that is used to refer the exported component. Named imports must have the name match the component being exported.

- What is the difference between named and default exports?

A default export allows the content of what is being exported to be named in the file which is importing it.
Default exports allow you to give any name you would like to the module which is being imported.
In contrast to default exports, Named exports maintain the name of the entity being exported from one module and imported into another. We want to use Named exports because it makes it easier for the TypeScript to provide assistance as you type.
